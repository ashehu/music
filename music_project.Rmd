## Project goal. 

What are some common features which make songs famous? unfamous? Can we predict weather a song will be famous?      

Some of the feature space to look at are:    

* lyrics sentiment        
* age: average group age, lead singer's age, highest age differential within the band.       
* intstruments     
* sex of main singer: male/female    
* genre    

**Extension** what role do lyrics play in a song? Are there certain words which can be given more weights.

* clean the data   
* explore the data for trends.   
* clusturing
